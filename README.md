# TopologicalOrderingInDirectedGraphs

This is a solution to determining the Topological Ordering of vertices in a graph.

A topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

Topological Sorting/Ordering is most commonly used for dependency resolution of tasks,
or in scheduling a sequence of jobs or tasks based on their dependencies

Here we are using the Depth First Search method to work out a solution.
